<ul>
<li>
In the hope of getting to know more about Mars and the possibility of life on its surface, a huge number of exploratory missions to different regions of the planet need to be conducted.
 </li>
 <li>
 Imagine (at some future time) that we have several rovers of different types and capabilities on the surface of Mars ready to carry out missions to its different regions. 
 </li>
  <li>
 There is also a hypothetical base station which acts as the central point from which the different rovers begin their exploratory missions and to which they return after mission completion. 
 </li>
 <li>
The base station basically assigns missions to the different rovers.
</li>
</ul>
